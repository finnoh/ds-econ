There there are many articles on the Dos and Don’ts of writing good code. I think writing good code is not always that black and white.

That's why today, we focus on some principles that prove to be true *often*, but maybe not always. We express these principles as inequalities, to show that behaviour A should be used more often than behaviour B, while still allowing for behaviour B to be used more often, than we would use a rare exception.

## Explicit > Implicit

Make explicit what you do. Examples for this include to write comments, document functions, and use the argument’s name when calling a function. Also, consider declaring datatypes for objects and arguments *explicitly*, such that everyone knows what to expect.

## Pen & Paper > Mouse & Keyboard

Plan what you are going to do on a sheet of paper. Pen & Paper beat “trying it out” in your code editor *almost* always.

## Flexible > Rigid

Keep it flexible. Pull out *magick* numbers from your code and set them at a specific location in your script. Write functions, get dimensions from existing objects, and turn your code into a package or module. The more flexible your code, the more adaptable it is. The more adaptable your code, the *more people* could use it.
