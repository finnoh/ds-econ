Many aspects of your data are just that: Aspects of your data. test
*Time, however, time changes everything.*

When you are dealing with a time series or panel data, the rules of the game change.

[You can look at nation's developing across centuries](__GHOST_URL__/seeded-lda/),
or stocks getting sold within seconds.

Time introduces patterns and trends that reveal important insights. Understanding **seasonality**, cyclical patterns, and long-term trends helps to understand the phenomenon.

You have to deal with date formats, periods, and missing days.

Time changes the nature of data.
Your data is now **dynamic**, it evolves. Time orders your data.

*Could I have known this already?*
Or am I modeling today, based on the tomorrow?

For neural networks, be careful with your **mini-batch**: Shuffling around the data is not valid anymore, the batches need to preserve the sequence of time.

Drawing samples becomes more difficult. If you want to **downsample** the data to have a smaller dataset, ensure you get data from every period.

*More time is not the same as more observations/people/units.*
A person playing Russian Roulette a hundred times is different from a hundred people playing Russian Roulette once.

Keep an eye on the time.
