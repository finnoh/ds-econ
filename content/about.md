I love reading books about life, working out, and drinking coffee on a sunny day. Before moving to Amsterdam, I lived in Tübingen, Texas, and on a Scottish Farm.

I worked as a data science intern at Lidl, the German Federal Bank, at the Institute for Applied Economic Research, and as an RA for the University of Tübingen and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, as well as a freelancer for a sports analytics startup.

I hold a B. Sc. in Economics and Business Administration, as well as a M. Sc. in Data Science in Business and Economics. Currently, I am a MPhil student in Business Data Science at the Tinbergen Institute.

In my weekly newsletter, The Repo, I curate a remarkable repository, programmer, and organization from the data science community. You can also find some of my long-form articles on Medium.
